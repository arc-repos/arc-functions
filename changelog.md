## [3.3.3] 2019-08-22

### Fixed

- Fixed `arc.static()` (and deprecated `arc.http.helpers.static()`) calls in Arc 6, fixes #59 /ht @mikemaccana

---

## [3.3.1 - 3.3.2] 2019-08-20

### Fixed

- Fixed `arc.tables()` calls in Arc 6

---

## [3.3.0] 2019-08-12

### Added

- Support for Architect 6
  - Includes complete compatibility for Architect 4 + 5 users:
    - If already using Functions, everything should just work!
    - If using Arc 5 dependency-free, you can now drop your existing responses into Architect Functions's `res()` and everything should be solid; no signature changes should be required
- Takes over all responsibilities of now-deprecated `@architect/data`
  - Previous data calls can be accessed with `arc.tables()`
- Responses now include the same content type aware `Cache-Control` defaults as found in Architect 5
  - As always, they're able to be overriden with `cacheControl` param (or `headers['Cache-Control']`)

### Changed

- Hopefully nothing breaking â€“ please send feedback on the RC!
  - 3.3 RC: https://github.com/architect/functions/issues/57
  - Slack: https://architecture-as-text.slack.com

---

## [3.2.2] 2019-07-11

### Added

- Including a `headers` object in your `arc.http` response will now set custom headers
- `SESSION_DOMAIN` variable now supported in `jwe` sessions
- `context` is now passed onto each middleware function

---

## [3.2.1] 2019-06-26

### Changed

- Backwards-compatible refactoring of `events` publishing in preparation for Architect 6 service discovery

---

## [3.2.0] 2019-06-14

### Added

- For additional control of your user sessions, you may now define the [cookie Domain attribute](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265#section-5.2.3)
  - Because this needs to be set consistently across your app's usage of session, set this via the `SESSION_DOMAIN` environment variable

---

## [3.1.0] 2019-06-05

### Added

- This release is all about improving static asset access!
  - Static asset fingerprinting is now built into the static asset helper!
    - Enable file fingerprinting in your project by adding `fingerprint true` to your Arc manifests's `@static` pramga
    - If enabled, requesting `styles.css` will return the proper fingerprinted URL (e.g. `https://your-bucket.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/styles-1e25d663f6.css`)
  - The static asset helper is now a first-class method accessible at: `arc.static('filename.ext')`
    - File path are still relative to your `public/` dir
    - Legacy method `arc.http.helpers.static('filename.ext')` will continue to be supported
  - Static helper tests

## [3.0.8] 2019-05-20

### Fixed

- `proxy.read()` calls without `config.bucket` specified work correctly again, fixes #38

---

## [3.0.7] 2019-05-11

### Added

- `arc.http.helpers.static()` now uses `ARC_STATIC_BUCKET` and `ARC_STATIC_FOLDER` (as introduced in 2.0.16 for `arc.proxy.read()`), fixes #37

### Fixed

- Also improves S3 URL handling in `arc.http.helpers.static()`, partially addressing @architect/architect#375 (S3's late-2020 URL format support change)

### Changed

- Updated dependencies

---

## [3.0.6] 2019-05-09

### Added

- Adds support for sending `delaySeconds` parameter on queue publish, closes #36 /ht @bardbachmann

---

## [3.0.3 - 3.0.5] - 2019-04-19

### Added

- `arc.events.subscribe` will now accept an `AsyncFunction`

### Fixed

- Removes trailing slash from `arc.http.helpers.static()` that breaks URLs when working locally

### Changed

- Updated dependencies


---

## [3.0.2] - 2019-04-10

### Fixed

- Fixes local sandbox publishing events/queues bug introduced in 2.0.8

---

## [3.0.1] - 2019-04-04

### Added

- Enables both text and binary file transit in newly provisioned Arc apps
- This is NOT a breaking update if you aren't using `proxy.public()`
  - However, if you use `proxy.public()`, this is a breaking update!
  - In order to enable binary assets support, Arc Functions now encodes files being emitted via `proxy.public()` for use in Architect 5.6+ apps
  - If you'd like your existing app that uses `proxy.public()` to serve binary assets, you'll need to re-create your API (or hang tight until we release our forthcoming API migration tool)

### Fixed

- `get /` encoding is now properly set when using `config.bucket.folder`

---

## [2.0.17 - 2.0.19] - 2019-04-02

### Fixed

- Added checks to ensure bucket exists in `proxy.public()`
- Requests to unknown files via `proxy.public()` now return a proper 404 response, and not 200 / `undefined`
- Fixes proxy path prefix check in testing environment
- Found and removed some junk files in the NPM package

---

## [2.0.16] - 2019-03-27

### Added

- Adds `ARC_STATIC_BUCKET` + `ARC_STATIC_FOLDER` env vars for config-reduced `proxy.public()` reads

### Fixed

- In `proxy.public()` config, the bucket folder prefix is now respected when working locally

---

## [2.0.15] - 2019-03-13

### Added

- Cache-control header support for `proxy.public`; if not specified, defaults to:
  - HTML + JSON: `no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate, max-age=0, s-maxage=0`
  - Everything else: `max-age=86400`

### Changed

- Updated dependencies

---

## [2.0.13-14] - 2019-03-08

### Fixed

- Fixed local env check in `queues.publish` /ht @tobytailor

---

## [2.0.1-2.0.11] - 2019-02-26

### Added

- proxy allows for configurable s3 bucket and folder
- proxied files now return `etag`
- `arc.proxy.public` configuration:
  - `spa` - boolean, load `index.html` at any folder depth
  - `ssr` - path string of module to load or function for overriding `/index.html`
  - `alias` - alias paths path (eg. `{'/css':'/styles/index.scss'}`)
  - `plugins` - per filetype transform plugin pipelines

The companion transform plugins aim to help developers make the transition to browser native esmodules:

- `@architect/proxy-plugin-jsx` transpiles jsx to preact/react
- `@architect/proxy-plugin-tsx` strips types and transpiles jsx to preact/react
- `@architect/proxy-plugin-mjs-urls` adds `/staging` or `/production` to imports urls
- `@architect/proxy-plugin-bare-imports` enable bare imports with browser esm

And for fun:

- `@architect/proxy-plugin-md` markdown to html
- `@architect/proxy-plugin-sass` sass/scss

> If you think we're missing a plugin please don't hesitate to ask in the issue tracker!
